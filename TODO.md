# To Do

## Repository 

- Add Contributing Guidelines

## Features to be Added

### Creatives
- Require users to categorize their to-be-submitted ideas
- Elimination of duplicate ideas (System MERGES (adding up might cause up-vote duplicates) up-votes into the existing idea after elimination)
- Create new categories categories 
- Eliminate duplicate categories
- Move categories and stuff under it
- Up-vote

### Developers
- Random idea generator
- Filtering options by category and difficulty
- Add estimated difficulty to ideas (exclude top and bottom 20% votes)
- Request to close ideas if they already exist 
- Up-vote?

## Logistics

- How do we get users to eliminate duplicate ideas/categories, move/create categories and still keep the whole database in order? 
    - Creatives can't do anything but create "issues". Get Developers to resolve 3-5 issues before they can browse ideas. Would this make the app squishy and scare away users?
- Find a way to eliminate user accounts, enforce control over devices (i.e ban devices instead of user accounts)(IP address maybe?)

## Design

- Design interface
